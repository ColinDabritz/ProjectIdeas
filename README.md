ProjectIdeas
============

* Integrated Thinking Environment (Integrated knowledge environment)
    * Focuses on thinking and reasoning about problems, associating knowledge and ideas
    * Could be a collection of tools, less integrated
    * Process help
    * Breaking down requirements
    * Finding ambiguity
    * Root cause analysis
    * Troubleshooting
    * Problem solving
    * Finding missing elements
    * Creativity, flow
    * Naming tool
    * Artifical landscape, showing requirements down to code, UI, interactions
    * Artificial building showing/made of requirements
    * Visibility of as much as possible
    * Virtual space? Unreal4 engine
    * Complexity identification, accidential or inherent?
    * Domain Specific Language thinking
* Naming tool website
    * Better naming process
    * Generator tools
    * Association and Juxtaposition tools (random?)
    * Capture and share sessions, sessions become PART of name, in source code, control
* Timelines
    * Better calendar, sine waves, overlapping, zooming, logarithmic falloff
    * Timelines as first class, place to rondevouz
    * Timelines that can handle time travel
    * Real timelines that follow Tufte rules, especially proportial representation (e.g. spaced by time correctly)
* Self-hosted livestreaming
    * Livestreaming code
* High fidelity source control
    * Capture every moment, thought, video, keystroke, change etc
    * No concept of "check-in" - This is constant, records ALL that happens in real time
    * Capture docs, notes whiteboards
    * Visiblity
* Desired State Configuration
* Comics
* The Animated Turring - A walk through Turing's computability paper, with interactive machines and related support
